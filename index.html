    <section id="aboutme">

      <h2>About me</h2>
      <img src="images/hr_rule.png" />
      <p>My name is Oualid, I am 25 years old and currently studying multimedia project management and web development (php)
        at the Openclassroom school in France. Openclassroom is a mooc offering degree courses.
      <p/>
      <p>Since I am in middle school I have had to stop traditional school and start studying at home because of certain medical
          conditions.
          The fact that I have always studied without being directly surrounded by a teacher has therefore made me much more autonomous,
          I always manage to solve the difficulties I may face. It also allowed me to improve my concentration and stay focused on the
          tasks assigned to me.</p>
      <p>
        After high school, I wanted to continue studying in the same way, which is why I joined the mooc Openclassroom and continue
        to train at a distance.
      </p>

      <p>However, distance learning also has a major disadvantage, which I did not see coming: the lack of self-confidence.
        Despite the fact of validating school projects, when I looked at the job offers I couldn't help but think to myself:
        but do I really have the ability to achieve the things mentioned in these job offers, especially when I don't understand
        certain terms?
      </p>

      <p>This experience made me realize that I didn't really know where to go once I graduated.
        That's why I started looking for other courses on the Internet, in order to acquire more skills.<br>
        As I watched some lessons, I could see how pleasant it could be to teach, I also remembered a word that someone said: <em class="citation">the best way to learn is to teach.</em>
        That's why I also joined some discords and started helping students with their codes. I spent whole evenings helping students and
        what a joy to see a student understand, succeed and above all gain self-confidence but also to be thanked in return.
      </p>

      <p>
        This experience has allowed me to open my eyes to what I really want to do, and especially how.
        What I want to do, is give or restore confidence to anyone who may doubt their ability.
        Whatever the school, the bootcamp, the training they have chosen, all these people will be able to benefit from a service
        that will restore their self-confidence and help them to progress.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have a good knowledge of HTML/CSS, as well as Wordpress CMS.<br>
        I also know the basics of php language as well as POO, Javascript and Bootstrap.
      </p>

      <p>
        I only want to progress and learn new things while being useful. I am not a random student who, once his task is completed,
        will go home and start his routine again the next day.<br>
        I'm the little brother you can count on to go pick up a pizza, go shopping, pick up the kids at school and finish all
        the tasks you give him anytime (or maybe not in the middle of a game).
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, i know that being a beginner with a lot of will isn't enough sometimes.
        My goal is not to find an <strong>apprenticeship</strong> or a work at all cost. I want to be useful with my abilities and my defaults.
      </p>

      <p>That's why, if my profile doesn't match your expectations, you can check the
        <a href="#halloffame"><strong>Hall of Fame</strong></a> and see if someone matches you.<br>
        These wonderful people will give you the best of themselves and are just waiting to be contacted.<br>
        So take a look at it.(work in progress)
